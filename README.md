Overview

This project implements an AI-powered bot that plays the game Jump Sturdy, a strategic game with similarities to chess. The bot is designed to play the game intelligently and improve over time through the application of various algorithms and AI techniques. The aim is to create a bot capable of making complex, well-thought-out decisions under a variety of circumstances and optimizing its gameplay with each round.

Features and Implemented Algorithms
The bot leverages several advanced algorithms and techniques, including but not limited to:

1. Alpha-Beta Pruning with Cutoffs
Description: Alpha-beta pruning is an optimization technique for minimax search algorithms used in decision-making processes, particularly in game-playing AI. It reduces the number of nodes evaluated in the search tree, speeding up the decision-making process.
Implementation: I have enhanced the basic alpha-beta search by adding cutoffs, limiting the depth of the search in certain situations, making it more efficient.
2. Ruhesuche (Quiescence Search)
Description: Quiescence search is used to avoid the horizon effect, where the bot might make poor decisions because it doesnâ€™t evaluate unstable positions deeply enough. It extends the search when the game state is volatile, typically in positions where significant changes, like captures, are possible.
Implementation: I integrated quiescence search to extend the search for certain critical moves, ensuring the bot doesnâ€™t overlook crucial game-changing moments.
3. Dynamic Time Management
Description: This algorithm helps the bot allocate its time more effectively. It adjusts the depth of the search based on the remaining time in the game or in specific phases of the game, optimizing for the most crucial moves.
Implementation: The bot dynamically adjusts its time management, allocating more time to critical decision points and optimizing the search depth based on game progression.
4. Transposition Table
Description: A transposition table is a memory-based technique used to store previously evaluated positions to avoid redundant calculations. This significantly speeds up the decision-making process.
Implementation: I implemented a transposition table that caches game states and their evaluations, improving the botâ€™s efficiency by recalling previously analyzed positions.
5. Evolutionary Learning
Description: Evolutionary learning is an optimization algorithm inspired by natural selection. The bot continuously evolves by selecting the best strategies from a population, mutating and recombining them to improve over time.
Implementation: The bot uses evolutionary algorithms to evolve its gameplay strategies, learning from past games and adapting its approach to become more effective with each iteration.
6. Other AI Enhancements
Heuristic Evaluation: The bot evaluates game states using custom heuristics, optimizing decision-making by assigning values to certain board positions.
Move Ordering: Implemented to prioritize the most promising moves first, increasing the efficiency of alpha-beta pruning by focusing on the most critical moves early on.
How to Use
Installation: Ensure that you have the necessary dependencies installed (e.g., a Python environment with libraries like NumPy).
Run the Bot: Execute the main script, which will start the Jump Sturdy bot. The bot can play against a human player or another AI.
Customization: You can tweak various parameters such as the depth of search, time management settings, or learning rates to fine-tune the bot's performance.

Future Improvements
Although the bot is highly intelligent and capable of complex decision-making, further improvements could include:

Deep Learning Integration: Using neural networks to enhance board evaluation.
Reinforcement Learning: Allowing the bot to learn even more effectively from its wins and losses.
Parallelization: Distributing the search process across multiple cores for faster decision-making.

Conclusion
This Jump Sturdy bot incorporates cutting-edge AI techniques to create an intelligent and competitive player that continues to evolve. It showcases the power of algorithms like alpha-beta pruning, quiescence search, and evolutionary learning in a complex, strategic game environment.
